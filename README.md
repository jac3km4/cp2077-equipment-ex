## Documentation

### Compatible items

Any item can support one base slot and one outfit slot at the same time,
making the item compatible with both the game equipment system and the outfit system.

The outfit slot must be added to the `placementSlots` property after the base slot:

```yaml
Items.MyNecklace:
  $base: Items.GenericHeadClothing
  placementSlots: 
    - !append OutfitSlots.NecklaceShort
```

Which is equivalent to:

```yaml
Items.MyNecklace:
  $base: Items.GenericHeadClothing
  placementSlots: 
    - AttachmentSlots.Head
    - OutfitSlots.NecklaceShort
```

If user doesn't have Equipment-EX installed, the item will still work with the base slot.

- The slot must represent an area or layer for only one item equipped at a time
- The slot must be named after a body part if possible, or equipment category otherwise
